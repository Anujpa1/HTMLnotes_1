        <h3>Que1. Difference between div and span?</h3>
        <p>
            The main difference between <b>Div</b> and <b>Span</b> is their default display behavior and the type of content they are typically used for:
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong> DIV: </strong> is a block-level element that is used to group and separate content into distinct sections or containers. By default, elements start on a new line and take up the full width available to them. They are commonly used for larger structural elements of a web page, such as header, footer, sidebar, or main content areas. You can apply CSS styles and manipulate the layout of elements using properties like width, height, margin, padding, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong> SPAN: </strong> is an inline-level element used to apply styles or target specific portions of text within a larger block of content. Unlike <b> div, span </b>elements do not start on a new line by default. They are typically used to add inline styling, apply CSS classes or IDs, or provide hooks for JavaScript interactions. <b>span</b> is often used within paragraphs or headings to style specific words or phrases differently.

        <div class="child3">
            <h3>Que2. Difference between class and IDs</h3>
            <p>The main differences between classes and IDs in HTML are as follows:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>IDS & CLASS: </b> IDs are unique identifiers that can only be used once on a web page, whereas classes are reusable and can be applied to multiple elements. Each ID must be unique within the HTML document, while classes can be used on multiple elements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="child4">
            <h4>EXAMPLE ID'S AND CLASS</h4>

            <h3>Que3. What are self closing tags</h3>
            <p><b>SELF CLOSING TAGS: </b>Self-closing tags, also known as void elements, are HTML tags that do not require a closing tag. These tags represent elements that do not contain any content or have no need for separate opening and closing tags.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="child7">
            <h4>EXAMPLE SELF CLOSING TAGS</h4>

            <h3>Que4. How many types of headings are there ?How to decide which to use where</h3>
            <p class="big"><b>HEADINGS OF HTML: </b>In HTML, there are six levels of headings, designated by the h1 to h6 tags. Each heading level represents a different level of importance and hierarchy in the structure of the content.

                The heading levels are as follows:
                
                h1: This represents the highest level of heading and is typically used for the main heading of a page or a major section.
                
                h2: This represents the second level of heading and is used for subheadings or sections within the main content.
                
                h3: This represents the third level of heading and is used for sub-sections within the h2 headings.
                
                h4, h5, h6: These represent lower levels of headings and are used for sub-sections within higher-level headings or for more granular organization of content.
                
                When deciding which heading level to use, it is important to consider the structure and hierarchy of your content. The heading levels should reflect the logical organization of the information on your page. Here are some general guidelines:
                
                Use h1 for the main title of the page. There should typically be only one h1 per page, representing the main focus or purpose of the content.
                
                Use lower-level headings (h2, h3, etc.) for subheadings or sections within the content. Each section should have a clear relationship to the higher-level heading it falls under.
                
                Follow a consistent hierarchical structure. For example, if you have an h2 heading, the sections within it should use h3 headings, and any subsections within those should use h4 headings, and so on.
                
                Avoid skipping heading levels. It is generally recommended to follow a sequential order and not jump from, for example, h2 to h4, as it can disrupt the logical flow and hierarchy of the content.
                
                By using appropriate heading levels, you can enhance the accessibility, readability, and organization of your content. Headings also play a role in search engine optimization (SEO), as search engines use them to understand the structure and importance of the content on your page.</p>

            <h3>Que5. Difference between block and inline?</h3>
            <p><b> Block-level elements: </b>Block-level elements create a block-level box that occupies the full width available to them and starts on a new line. Example: <b>DIV, P, H1 TO H6, UL, LI, SECTION, ARTICLE</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>INLINE-LEVEL ELEMENTS: Inline-level elements do not start on a new line and only take up the space necessary to accommodate their content. They flow within the surrounding text or other inline elements. Example: <b>SPAN, STRONG, EM, IMG, INPUT, BR.</b></b>
            
    </p>
        </div>

        <div class="child11">
            <h3>Que6. What are attributes?</h3>
            <p>In HTML, attributes are additional properties that can be added to HTML elements to provide additional information or define specific characteristics. Attributes are specified within the start tag of an HTML element and consist of a name and a value.
                <br>
                Here's the basic syntax of an attribute:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="child12">
            <img src="7.png" alt="" class="img">
        </div>
        <div class="child13">
            <h3>Que7. Explain br tags?</h3>
            <p>The <b>br</b> tag in HTML stands for "line break" and is a self-closing tag, which means it doesn't require a closing tag. It is used to insert a single line break or line break equivalent within a block of text.
            <br>
            Here's an example of how the br tag is used:
        </p>

            <h4>INPUT:</h4>
            <img src="8.png" alt="" class="img">
            <h4>OUTPUT:</h4>
            <img src="9.png" alt="" class="img1">
        </div>
        <div class="child15">
            <h3>Que8. Explain how many different types of lists we have in html</h3>
            <p><b>1. Unordered Lists (ul):</b> Unordered lists are used to create bulleted lists where the order of items is not important. Each list item is represented by li (list item) tags. By default, unordered lists display bullet points before each item. <br><b>EXAMPLE:</b><br>
            <img src="10.png" alt="" class="img">
            <br>
            <img src="11.png" alt="" class="img">
            <br>
            <b>ORDERED LIST: </b>Ordered lists are used to create numbered or ordered lists where the order of items is important. Each list item is represented by li tags. By default, ordered lists display numbers or other ordered markers before each item. <br>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b><br>
            <img src="12.png" alt="" class="img">
            <br>
            <img src="13.png" alt="" class="img"><br>
            <b>DEFINITION LIST: </b>Description lists are used to create lists that consist of terms (labels) and their corresponding descriptions. Each term is represented by dt (description term) tags, and each description is represented by dd (description) tags. <br>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b>
            <br>
            <img src="14.png" alt="" class="img"><br>
            <img src="15.png" alt="" class="img">
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="child16">
            <h3>Que9. What are semantic tags?</h3>
            <p><b>1. header: </b>Represents the introductory or navigational section of a document or a section within it. <br>
            <b>2. nav: </b>Defines a section of navigation links. <br>
            <b>3. main:</b> Represents the main content of a document. <br>
            <b>4. article:</b> Defines an independent, self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article. <br>
            <b>5. aside: </b>Defines content that is tangentially related to the main content, often presented in a sidebar or as a separate block. <br>
            <b>6. section:</b> Represents a thematic grouping of content within a document. <br>
            <b>7. footer:</b> epresents the footer section of a document or a section within it, typically containing information like copyright notices, contact details, or sitemap links. <br>
            <b>8. h1 to h6:</b> Heading tags that represent different levels of section headings, with h1 being the highest and h6 being the lowest.
            </p>

        <div class="child17">
            <h3>Que10. Difference between HTML tags and elements?</h3>
            <p>
                <b>1. HTML Tags:</b> HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML document. They are used to mark up and define the structure and elements within the document. HTML tags are written as pairs with an opening tag and a closing tag, and they enclose the content that they affect. For example, p is an opening tag for a paragraph, and /p pis the corresponding closing tag. Tags define the beginning and end of an element. <br><br>
                <b>2. HTML ELEMENTS: </b> HTML elements consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. They are composed of one or more HTML tags and the content placed between those tags. The content can be text, images, links, or other elements. For example, p is the opening tag of a paragraph element, the content is the text or other elements within the paragraph, and /p is the closing tag.
